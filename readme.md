# mealpickr

## Available now at: mealpickr.ca

mealpickr is a mobile-first developed single-page web application built in Typescript using React. I built mealpickr to take the stress out of deciding on what to eat, and introduce new recipes to my modest roster. Users can give mealpickr any intolerences, dietary restrictions, or cuisine choices they may have, and then get a batch of random meals to go through. If all parameters are left blank, the odds of ever getting the same recipe twice is extremely unlikely. All meals are provided through the Spoonacular API, with over 5,000 meals available as of this writing.

*Disclaimer:* This is a pet project by one person, so while I did my best to cover most device sizes, some may be slightly wonky looking. For best results, use on mobile.
